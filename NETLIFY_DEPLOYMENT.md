# Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio to Netlify with serverless functions support.

## Why Netlify?

‚úÖ **Free hosting** for personal projects
‚úÖ **Automatic deployments** from GitHub
‚úÖ **Serverless functions** (for recommendations feature)
‚úÖ **Custom domains** with free SSL
‚úÖ **Build previews** for pull requests
‚úÖ **Perfect for AI chat features** (future enhancement)

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub account (you have this)
2. Netlify account (free - sign up at https://netlify.com)
3. GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` and `write:org` scopes

## Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: `Netlify Portfolio Functions`
4. Select scopes:
   - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ‚úÖ `write:org` (Read and write org data - needed for issues)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

## Step 2: Connect GitHub to Netlify

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" ‚Üí "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "GitHub"
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
5. Select your repository: `jordpo/jordpo.github.io`

## Step 3: Configure Build Settings

Netlify should auto-detect the settings, but verify:

- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist`
- **Functions directory:** `netlify/functions`

Click "Deploy site"

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables

After the initial deploy:

1. Go to "Site configuration" ‚Üí "Environment variables"
2. Click "Add a variable"
3. Add the following:

   **Key:** `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   **Value:** [Paste your GitHub Personal Access Token]
   **Scopes:** All scopes (Production, Deploy Previews, Branch deploys)

4. Click "Create variable"

## Step 5: Trigger Redeploy

Since you added environment variables after the first deploy:

1. Go to "Deploys"
2. Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy site"

This ensures the function has access to the GITHUB_TOKEN.

## Step 6: Update GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to keep your `jordpo.github.io` domain:

1. Go to your Netlify site settings
2. Navigate to "Domain management" ‚Üí "Custom domains"
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Enter: `jordpo.github.io`
5. Follow instructions to update your GitHub Pages DNS settings

Alternatively, Netlify will provide a free subdomain like `jordpo-portfolio.netlify.app`.

## Step 7: Test the Recommendations Feature

Once deployed:

1. Visit your Netlify site URL
2. Scroll to the Recommendations section
3. Click "Add a Recommendation"
4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Check your GitHub repository for a new issue!
6. Comment `/approve` on the issue to create the PR

## Troubleshooting

### Function returns 500 error
- Check that `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- Verify the token has correct permissions (`repo` and `write:org`)
- Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

### CORS errors
- The function includes CORS headers, but check browser console for details
- Ensure you're using the Netlify domain (not localhost for production testing)

### Build fails
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify Node version matches (20)

## Features Available After Deployment

### Current:
- ‚úÖ Recommendations system with serverless function
- ‚úÖ Automatic PR creation via `/approve` comments
- ‚úÖ No GitHub account required for visitors

### Future (Easy to Add):
- ü§ñ AI chat window powered by Claude/OpenAI
- üìä Analytics integration
- üîç Search functionality
- üì¨ Contact form with serverless backend

## Local Development with Netlify Functions

To test functions locally:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Run local dev server with functions
netlify dev
```

This will:
- Start your Vite dev server
- Run functions at `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/`
- Use environment variables from `.env` file

Create a `.env` file (don't commit this!):
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

## Cost

**Free tier includes:**
- 100 GB bandwidth/month
- 125,000 serverless function requests/month
- Unlimited sites
- Automatic HTTPS

Perfect for personal portfolio! If you add AI chat later, the free tier is still plenty.

## Next Steps

4. üé® (Optional) Set up custom domain
5. ü§ñ (Future) Add AI chat feature
