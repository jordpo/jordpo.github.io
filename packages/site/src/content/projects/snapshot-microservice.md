Distributed microservice for capturing and rendering user-action snapshots at scale. Critical for audit trails and compliance in high-stakes auction environments.

## Technical Challenges

- DOM serialization across different browsers and states
- Handling concurrent screenshot requests during peak auction times
- Distributed rendering architecture for performance
- Storage and retrieval optimization for millions of images

## Scale

- Processes over 1 million screenshots during major auction events
- Sub-second response times for snapshot capture
- Maintains complete audit trail for compliance
